This is a file to explain how to write selenium test

1. download/install firefox plugin SELENIUM IDE from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

2. use SELENIUM IDE to create test case (Firefox!!!)

3. export test case to Java file (File -> Export Test Case As -> Java/Junit4/WebDrive)

4. put java file to web/src/test/java/selenium

5. modify package and class name

6. modify the content of java file
   Note IMPORTANT: Normally, this file can't be used directly because SELENIUM IDE
                    is not 100% compatible with Selenium WebDirve, So you need to
                    modify several methode in this file to make it work.

7. How to run test (you need to run this test when web application is running):
   mvn test -DskipSeleniumTests=false
